# Feature Engineering
For project #7, Artificial Intelligence SP25

Fits into the current schedule just before lectures on machine learning start. I think it would be useful for students to learn a bit about steps they should take before exploring all the possible machine learning algorithms and neural networks. ML models in particular rely a lot on the quality of the input data.

This repo includes a set of slides that would be used during lecture. Slides which ask for discussion expect ~5 minutes to be taken for students to exchange ideas. Resources are provided at the end for students to explore notebooks in their own time for practice.
